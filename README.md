# analysis-of-police-shooting-in-the-united-states
This project analyzes USA shootings (2015-present) using victim data. Findings show limited bodycam coverage, high armed non-fleeing suspects, and state-specific patterns (e.g., California, Arizona, Colorado). Logistic regression predicts death manner. Despite limitations, it contributes insights for community safety.

#About
in recent years, there has been an almost exponential rise of shootings in the United States. The information we gathered includes details on shootings that occurred in every US county from 2015 till the most recent week. Geographic shooting sites, the victim's armed status, whether or not they fled, the weapon they carried, their name, the location (county, state, city), the date, their race, and other details are among the data gathered from the dataset. We intended to solve the problems in the following manner using the information provided above.

1. Are the shootings captured on bodycam footage?
2. How many people were armed with a deadly weapon?
3. How many persons who were armed stayed put during the incident. Were they potentially a threat to the police? Could that be one of the things that contributed to.
