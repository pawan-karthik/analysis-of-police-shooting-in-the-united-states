# analysis-of-police-shooting-in-the-united-states
This project analyzes USA shootings (2015-present) using victim data. Findings show limited bodycam coverage, high armed non-fleeing suspects, and state-specific patterns (e.g., California, Arizona, Colorado). Logistic regression predicts death manner. Despite limitations, it contributes insights for community safety.
